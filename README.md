# Python-Classification-and-Processing-MNIST-data
This project explores how well the perceptron algorithm works to classify images of handwritten digits, from the well-known MNIST dataset, buiding on feature extraction from images. This exercise will highlight how important feature extraction is, before linear classification is done, using algorithms such as the perceptron.
